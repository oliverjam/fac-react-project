# Tamagotchi Project!

The goal is to build a Tamagotchi.



It should:

- Let you submit a name
- Query the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (or any other [fun one](https://www.potterapi.com/) you like
- Populate a UI with the user details
- Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  - A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
  - A button to add more users to your collection

Try to:

- Write modular code: one component per file
- Separate your container logic from presentational components

### Stretch goals

- Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- Make it look like a real Tamagotchi!
